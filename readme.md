Welcome to My Music App-SONGIFY

Brief

In Songify-User Perspective:

When we open my application Songify,we could able to see the playlist which contains the available songs to be played one by one in a Listview.As every music app,Songify provides all necessary functionalities like Start,Pause,Stop,Play_Next and Play_Previous. Inaddition,we could see a menu at top-right which enables us to go to the playlist and also to exit,Finally when closing,an alert dialog will pop-up for assuring before exiting the application.


Technical Perspective:

we do have the required files starting from mainActivity to CustomArrrayList for the detailing of songs informations,DataBaseHelper for dealing the Database to store the images and informations,SongList for all the songs to be played.
The songs are placed in the folder Raw and just like drawable we can easily keep songs in Raw and by usimg the database and ArrayList we can display the song along with its data like title and name.
Thankyou.
